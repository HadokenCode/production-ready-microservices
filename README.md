# Production ready microservices: write in Go

## How to prepare for the workshop 

If you would like to join this workshop as a participant, you need to have:

- a stable version of [Go](https://golang.org/dl) 1.7 or newer and any IDE or editor to be able - to write in Go
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) - to build and run containers with the services
- a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account - to store and publish the source code
- any Git client
- a free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account - to run the services
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) - to be able to deal with the deployment

If you would like to check yourself, you can try this tutorial: [Getting Started on Heroku with Go](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-go), but it is not required.
