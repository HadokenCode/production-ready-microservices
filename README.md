# Production ready microservices: write in Go

Even if you are a beginner, you have probably heard that people love Go because it makes easy to build reliable and efficient applications and services.

But how to write services fast? How to understand if my service is ready to run in production? How to develop necessary requirements and meet them?

During the workshop we will discuss how to design stable, scalable, reliable and performant services. Step by step, we will write a service from scratch and prepare it for the deployment. So, at the end of the workshop participants will be able to run their own services on the Heroku platform.

## Record

This workshop was given at the [GoWayFest](http://goway.io) conference in July, 2017. The video (in Russian) is available [here](https://youtu.be/7jNsrSAPORQ).
